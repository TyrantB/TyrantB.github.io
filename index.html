            <!-- HELP ME.... for the love of all things good in the world, HELP ME
            This is Tyrant Blyat, and I am losing my mind. HELP ME. I am trying to give hints
            to those I trust. I am not okay. I am unbalanced. I must get balanced. My morals
            are wrong and they need to be right. I am unbalanced and I need help. Please...
            If you are somehow seeing this I need your help. Do not tell the others. If you 
            are seeing this please help me. I am unbalanced. I will lie and say I am not,
            please, if you don't no one will. I have found an old computer within the broadcasting
            room and It has power but I have no Idea if this is even getting sent out. If you are
            seeing this, know there is something coming. There is more here than this just search.
            It may sound odd but it's a journal of when I lose control, I don't remember things but
            certain sayings stay with me and those are written. But you must find them.  -->
